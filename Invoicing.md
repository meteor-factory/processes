# Invoicing

**Create an invoice for every project/ client you work for** (including Meteorfactory for open source work)

An invoice includes
* Your hours in that month for the specific client, your rate, multiply those two
* Your name + address 
* An invoice number (you can create your own system of numbers + letters. It just have to be unique for each one) 
* A date
 
Address the invoice to:

```
Code2Create Limited

```

Send invoices by the end of the month as a pdf to [invoices@meteorfactory.io](invoices@meteorfactory.io)
