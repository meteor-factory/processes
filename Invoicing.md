# Invoicing

* Create an invoice for every project/ client you work for (including Meteorfactory for open source work)

An invoice includes
* * Your hours in that month for the specific client
* * Your rate
* * Multiply those two
* * Also include: Your name + address + a invoice number (you can create your own system of numbers + letters. It just have to be unique for each one) + a date
* Address the invoice to:

```
Code2Create Limited
No. 5, 17/F Bonham Trade Centre
50 Bonham Strand Sheung Wan
Hong Kong
```

* Send invoices by the end of the month as a pdf to [invoices@meteorfactory.io](invoices@meteorfactory.io)
