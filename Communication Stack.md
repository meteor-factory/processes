# Communication Stack

The tools we primarily use for communicating are

* **Trello** - for project management
* **Slack** - for chat
* **Github** - for code

## Trello
Typical columns for trello would be
* **Ideas** - Tasks that might be done
* **Backlog** - Tasks that should eventually be done
* **Todo / Sprint [date]** - The next set of tasks to be done / completed for the end of the sprint
* **In progress** - Tasks that are actively being worked on
* **Pull Request** - A PR has been created in Github
* **Testing MF** - To be tested by Meteor Factory project manager
* **Testing** - To be tested by the client
* **Tested** - Passed by the client

### Assigning
The active developer should be assigned to the card. This means that you're responsible for the card and are 'blocking' the cards completion.

* Assign yourself to the cards you're working on
* If you're waiting for mockups etc. assign the designer / move the card to backlog
* Assign yourself to cards that you'd be good at (e.g. worked on before)
* Try not to overassign yourself, as it may stop other devs from jumping on the card

### Testing
When a card passes, it is moved into the next column.

When a card fails, it should receive the label 'Failed Test' and be moved into the 'To do / Sprint' column

### Labels
Labels can be created where useful.

Most common labels:
* Bug
* Failed test
